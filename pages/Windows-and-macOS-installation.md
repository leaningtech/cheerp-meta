title: Windows and macOS installation
---

We provide pre-built Windows and macOS binaries on the main project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerp-meta/releases) for your convenience.

# Windows
Download the latest binary installer executable from [GitHub](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerp-meta/releases) and follow the installation wizard. The default installation path is currently the only supported one. Cheerp compiler will be accessible as `c:\cheerp\bin\clang++.exe`

# macOS
Download the DMG image for macOS from from [GitHub](https://github.com/leaningtech/cheerp-meta/releases) and install it by opening the image and drag-and-dropping Cheerp into the `/Applications` directory. Cheerp compiler will be accessible as `/Applications/cheerp/bin/clang++`

The binary is not signed so you may need to run the following to stop Gatekeeper from blocking the executable:
```shell
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/cheerp/bin/*
```
