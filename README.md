## What is Cheerp?

Cheerp is a C/C++ compiler to WebAssembly and JavaScript, based on and integrated into the LLVM/Clang infrastructure, and featuring numerous custom optimisation steps to maximise performance and minimise size of the compiled JavaScript/WebAssembly output. Thanks to this, Cheerp is the best performing, most optimised C++ to WebAssembly compiler available on the market.

Cheerp is used primarily to port existing C/C++ libraries and applications to HTML5, but can also be used to write high-performance Web applications and WebAssembly components from scratch. Using Cheerp, C/C++ code gets compiled into JavaScript/WebAssembly and optimised, with the right JavaScript interfaces being exposed, and can easily be integrated in a web application.
